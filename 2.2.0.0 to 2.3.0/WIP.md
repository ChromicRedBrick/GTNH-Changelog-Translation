Changes the module destruction function to the function that @GTNH-Colen suggested in the Discord.
*Each module now makes 10,000,000
*The max modules allowed is 10,000, so that the maximum EU/t is 100,000,000,000 EU/t
*Makes the maximum computation allowed 1000000 computation per second
*Changes the recipe time to 1 hour so that the modules get consumed at the correct rate, it also takes longer to full now about 7 days to get to 100,000,000,000 EU/t (assuming 1 stack at a time, more should be possible)
*Changed the tool tip to mach the function changes
